# Data Cleaning and Dashboard Visualization 
- Uploaded and cleaned the dirty raw data for The Powerful Women dataset and visualized my results using Power BI as a visualization tool.
- The dirty raw data was cleaned on the Power Query editor in Power BI before use.
- I created a report that would aid a seamless visualization.
- The dashboard was created with the use of Cards (displaying the distinct total countries, the total sectors and average age in the data set), line chart (displaying the average age by sector), a Slicer of all Sectors (tapping on the respective sectors would give a descriptive visualization attached to that particular sector) and a Stacked Bar Chart (displaying the distinct total countries by sector).
